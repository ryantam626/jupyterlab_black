# NOTE

If you are using Python3.6+, feel free to use [my other less hacky plugin](https://github.com/ryantam626/jupyterlab_code_formatter) - it supports YAPF and autopep8 as well.

However if you are using Python2 or Python(<3.5), keep going.

# jupyterlab_black

A JupyterLab extension to apply [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) formatter to code within codecell.

Here is a little demo. Apologies for the horrid quality, I promise to find a better converter...

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryantam626/jupyterlab_black/master/jupyterlab_black_demo.gif)

## Prerequisites

* JupyterLab
* A Python 3.6+ anywhere on your system with `black` installed

## Installation

From your existing environment with jupyterlab installed do the following:

```bash
jupyter labextension install @ryantam626/jupyterlab_black
pip install https://github.com/ryantam626/jupyterlab_black/archive/master.zip
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_black
```

### Python3.6+ Kernel Notes

Install black with something like:

```base
conda install -c conda-forge black
```

OR

```base
pip install black
```

Find out path of your Python by `which python` and that would be what to put for `blackPythonBin` in the Usage section.

### Non-Python3.6+ Kernel Notes

If you are using kernel that are not Python3.6+, create another environment with Python3.6+ and black installed, for example (with conda, my perferred environment manager):

```bash
conda create --name py36_for_jupyterlab_black -c conda-forge python=3.6 black
```

Then find out where this lives by:

```bash
source activate py36_for_jupyterlab_black
which python
```

It should be something like `/home/ryan/lib/anaconda2/envs/py36_for_jupyterlab_black/bin/python`, depending on your distribution of conda, that would be what to put for `blackPythonBin` in the Usage section.

### Usage

Head over to settings editor, and key in the python interpreter path of that Python3.6+ you have with black installed for `blackPythonBin`.

There is literally one option in the command palette right now:

* `Apply Black Formatter`

### How about a keyboard shortcut?

Add an extra extry to your keyboard shortcuts settings with something like

```
{"jupyterlab_black:format":{
    "command": "jupyterlab_black:format",
    "keys": [
        "Ctrl K",
        "Ctrl L"
    ],
    "selector": ".jp-Notebook.jp-mod-editMode"
}}
```

This basically says "Under edit mode (detected through the selector), using the chord Ctrl K + Ctrl L, invoke the `jupyterlab_black:format` command". And there you have it :tada:

## Development

For a development install (requires npm version 4 or later), do the following in the repository directory:

```bash
pip install -e .
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_black
npm install
npm run build
jupyter labextension install . --no-build
```

Get npm and jupyter to watch for changes:

```bash
npm run watch  # in terminal 1
jupyter lab --watch  # in terminal 2
```

Making changes in the Python part of the plugin will require a rerun of `jupyter lab --watch` sadly.
